        <p class="section-lead">Leading the design of app features from 0 -> 1        </p>
        <p>
            As the sole designer for kura kura, I worked closely with the founder lead the product roadmap and design direction of various features for the past year. 
            <br> For this specific feature, we had a scope of less than 2 months for concepting, designing, and researching at part time capacity.

        <h2>Higher Level Problem</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">Roster planners don't have visibility and insight to the fairness of the roster, generated by the machine.</p>
        <p>When a normally manual process is automated, roster planners lose the insight to easily identifiable information for the tradeoffs are made.</p>
        <p class="section-lead">This led to manual, time consuming workarounds when evaluating if a generated roster is good and fair enough for the staff rostered.</p>
        <p>The automation process leaves the roster planner completely out of the loop when creating a roster.</p>

        <p class="section-lead">How might roster planners evaluate if a roster is 'good enough' through rules?</p>
        <p>Roster planners need 3 types of rule information to evaluate the generated roster</p>
        <p>One of the insights we discovered was what about information about rules was important to see.</p>
        
        <div class="example-card">
            <h4>Example use case:</h4>
            <p>If roster isn't able to fulfill a '20 staff per day' rule, a roster planner would need to know where (i.e. Monday) and degree (i.e. only 18 staff were rostered).</p>

                <h3>Catering to everyone meant catering to no one</h3>
                <p>During the initial part of my internship, we faced a lot of issues during testing and research of people not understanding our product. Upon reflection, this taught me to being judicious about what and who to prioritise for. In this case, we decided to focus on tech savvy roster planners for the time being.</p>

                <h3>Conducting group design critiques when it's hard to hear directly from users</h3>
                <p>Often times hearing from the user is ideal, but I don't always have access to them especially with a small user base. I learnt how to prepare and present my work amongst designers which gave me invaluable feedback on explorations, design details, and other considerations. This taught me to organise types of feedback given and build confidence to share designs in various types of fidelity.</p>
