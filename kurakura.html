        <p class="section-lead">A lack of foundational mental health support systems for Singaporean youths.</p>
        <p>In Singaporean schools and Asian cultures, we're not specifically encouraged to open up – suppressing, hiding, and stifling your emotions are very common. When we open up, it can also be difficult to navigate such situations.</p>
        <p>76% of youths are not comfortable being vulnerable in their current digital support channels, and efforts to build external support systems don't directly support youths themselves.</p>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Emotion identifying flows are often too reductive</h4>
                <p>Many journaling apps encourage quick entries, which can turn into unhelpful venting rather than meaningful reflection.</p>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Journaling feels repetitive and youths feel unengaged</h4>
