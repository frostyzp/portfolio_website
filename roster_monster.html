                <h3>Roster</h3>
                <p>A roster is a schedule or list that outlines the assignment of tasks, shifts, or responsibilities for a group of people.</p>

        <h3>Why such a product/solution?</h3>
        <p>In public sectors such as healthcare, roster planning can be highly complex, time consuming, and mentally draining. Enterprise software and solutions are costly, and not flexible enough for roster planning. To further justify these as a designer on the product:</p>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Business goals</h4>
                <p>Save time and business costs on enterprise softwares, allowing roster planners to focus on more / other important work.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Design goals</h4>
                <p>Reduce the human errors from manual rostering whilst giving enough clarity to the automated processes.</p>

        <p class="section-lead">Roster planners don't have visibility and insight to the fairness of the roster, generated by the machine.</p>
        <p>When a normally manual process is automated, roster planners lose the insight to easily identifiable information for the tradeoffs are made.</p>
        <p class="section-lead">This led to manual, time consuming workarounds when evaluating if a generated roster is good and fair enough for the staff rostered.</p>
        <p>The automation process leaves the roster planner completely out of the loop when creating a roster.</p>

        <h3>Impact on time and effort for roster planners</h3>
        <p>As the product is still in it's early MVP development, we weren't able to get qualitative metrics. We were still able to hear how roster planners have been using the product:</p>
        
        <div class="impact-quote">

        <h2>Research -> Problem Framing</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">How might roster planners evaluate if a roster is 'good enough' through rules?</p>
        <p>Roster planners need 3 types of rule information to evaluate the generated roster</p>
        <p>One of the insights we discovered was what about information about rules was important to see.</p>
        
        <div class="concept-card">
            <h3>Example use case:</h3>
            <p>If roster isn't able to fulfill a '20 staff per day' rule, a roster planner would need to know where (i.e. Monday) and degree (i.e. only 18 staff were rostered).</p>

        <p class="section-lead">Will building this feature amongst others move the needle?</p>

        <p>Hearing the user challenges through interviews and our feedback loop helped me justify the decision (with good confidence) to push for a high impact, high effort feature.</p>

        <h2>DESIGN DETAIL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">Focusing on the most important, relevant rule violation information</p>
        <p>From interviews and shadowing, they generally look out for information in this order. For example, if a roster isn’t able to fulfill a ‘20 staff per day’ rule, a roster planner would need to know where (i.e. Monday) and degree (i.e. only 18 staff were rostered). </p>
        <img src="romo/ogp/ogp_table.png" class="solution-video">

        <p> Some keys insights from the usability tests:</p>

        <div class="concept-cards">
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>No table headers looks, feels cleaner</h4>
                <p>Table header information was not relevant and took up unnecessary space to roster planners.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Accordion helps with showing relevant info</h4>
                <p>Accordion worked well as intended, allowing focus on specific rule violations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>Info hierarchy can be a bit tough to navigate</h4>
                <p>Grids helped, already quite a lot of text to process. Hierarchy was not as clear.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="section-lead">Being intentional with whitespace and visual clutter</p>

        <p>I focused a lot on using the right type size, colors, and even spacing to create an information hierarchy akin to how roster planners would need to see the information.</p>
        <img src="romo/ogp/ogp_finaliteration.png" class="solution-video">

        <h2>INTERACTION DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">Maximising the view for roster planners</p>
        <p>During a testing session, I noted that a roster planner would ideally like to see both the roster and the drawer summary for reference. This meant hiding irrelevant information, such as hiding sidebar by default.</p>
        <img src="romo/ogp/ogp_hide_sidebar.png" class="solution-video">

        <h2>HIGHER LEVEL DESIGN FLOW, EDGE CASES</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">Bringing clarity to the backend roster generation process</p>
        <p>Generating a roster can take up to 5 minutes, conveyed through the spinning circle of death. I spared an hour to quickly create a pop-up modal with a simple animation using After Effects and additional copywriting, which my engineer could easily implement in minutes.</p>

                <h3>Catering to everyone meant catering to no one</h3>
                <p>During the initial part of my internship, we faced a lot of issues during testing and research of people not understanding our product. Upon reflection, this taught me to being judicious about what and who to prioritise for. In this case, we decided to focus on tech savvy roster planners for the time being.</p>

                <h3>Conducting group design critiques when it's hard to hear directly from users</h3>
                <p>Often times hearing from the user is ideal, but I don't always have access to them especially with a small user base. I learnt how to prepare and present my work amongst designers which gave me invaluable feedback on explorations, design details, and other considerations. This taught me to organise types of feedback given and build confidence to share designs in various types of fidelity.</p>
